import Calendar, Interface, Log, Server

## Main entry point for the software. This program will:
# 1. Create a new Calendar.
# 2. If a logfile exists, load it and add log entries to the generated calendar.
# 3. Create a new server class
# 4. Launch the interface controller, passing in the server class
# 5. Handle clean exits :)
